# SocialMedia-App

- Social media apps are common/useful and are used by everyone
- So we are creating an `open source` SOCIAL MEDIA App.

## Project Flow

- `FRONTEND`: this is most important part from client's perspective
- `BACKEND`: this part is important from developers point of view as they have to manage the project later on
- We are focusing on both of them to provide a better/useful app
